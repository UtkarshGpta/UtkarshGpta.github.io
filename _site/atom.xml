   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am done! My first blog post&amp;#39;s live on the internet. Don&amp;#39;t go by the title, I&amp;#39;m not going to teach you a language or something. Calling it a maiden post would do :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on my mind to write a blog since a long time ago but time constraint (&lt;del&gt;laziness&lt;/del&gt;) didn&amp;#39;t allow. So, I was back in my dorm room after a hectic week when I decided to do something productive - something that I&amp;#39;ve been thinking to do since long and that&amp;#39;s when the idea of writing a blog struck me. I&amp;#39;ve always had a keen interest in building things, developing software/applications and learning new programming languages. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been following up articles over the web laying emphasis upon developers to write blogs for healthy coding. While I was pondering over what to write, my eyes got stuck at the medium sized whiteboard on the wall on which was written - Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where to write?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found this interesting thing over the internet by the name Jekyll. I really liked its idea - static web pages, fast, reliable and on top of that, secure as there were no databases involved. I had been thinking to try it out too - giving me some inside into Markdown and Liquid templating. And did I mention, it&amp;#39;s blog aware! Using its basic theme and some terminal commands, you can have your blog up and running within a few minutes! So, there were no second thoughts regarding where to write! Since I wanted to build it up myself, it took me some time to learn the basic structure of Jekyll which I shall cover up in my upcoming posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How did it go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning, it had been just like a cakewalk - following up the steps - change, commit, push and voila we have a basic but not so good looking blog! And here is when opensource comes to save us! I decided to take up a previous work, change it according to my needs - since now I know the directory structure in which Jekyll works. But that wasn&amp;#39;t easy enough. Due to different version of Jekyll, some times I was frustrated enough to leave it but it was the end result that acted as a driving force to keep me working. But here I am writing this blog post at 3 a.m. with DeathNote soundtrack playing in the background!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall discuss the technicalities in some later blog post, you should try it too. See you then !&lt;/p&gt;
