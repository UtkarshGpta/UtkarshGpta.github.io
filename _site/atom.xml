   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am done! My first blog post&amp;#39;s live on the internet. Don&amp;#39;t go by the title, I&amp;#39;m not going to teach you a language or something. Calling it a maiden post would do :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on my mind to write a blog since a long time ago but time constraint (&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;laziness&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) didn&amp;#39;t allow. So, I was back in my dorm room after a hectic week when I decided to do something productive - something that I&amp;#39;ve been thinking to do since long and that&amp;#39;s when the idea of writing a blog struck me. I&amp;#39;ve always had a keen interest in building things, developing software/applications and learning new programming languages. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been following up articles over the web laying emphasis upon developers to write blogs for healthy coding. While I was pondering over what to write, my eyes got stuck at the medium sized whiteboard on the wall on which was written - &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where to write?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found this interesting thing over the internet by the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I really liked its idea - &lt;strong&gt;static web pages&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reliable&lt;/strong&gt; and on top of that, &lt;strong&gt;secure&lt;/strong&gt; as there were no databases involved. I had been thinking to try it out too - giving me some inside into &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Liquid templating&lt;/em&gt;. And did I mention, it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;blog aware&lt;/strong&gt;! Using its basic theme and some terminal commands, you can have your blog up and running within a few minutes! So, there were no second thoughts regarding where to write! Since I wanted to build it up myself, it took me some time to learn the basic structure of Jekyll which I shall cover up in my upcoming posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did it go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning, it had been just like a cakewalk - following up the steps - change, commit, push and voila we have a basic but not so good looking blog! And here is when opensource comes to save us! I decided to take up a previous work, change it according to my needs - since now I know the directory structure in which Jekyll works. But that wasn&amp;#39;t easy enough. Due to different version of Jekyll, some times I was frustrated enough to leave it but it was the end result that acted as a driving force to keep me working. But here I am writing this blog post at 3 a.m. with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcVdjZN0-D4&quot;&gt;DeathNote soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; playing in the background and satisfaction in the heart!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall discuss the technicalities in some later blog post, you should try it too. See you then !&lt;/p&gt;
