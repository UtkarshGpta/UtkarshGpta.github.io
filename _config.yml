title_description: "I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering at IIT Roorkee.
I am a self-learned developer who first googled - <i>\"how to make a website\"</i> and was struck with 
awe as the color of text on the screen changed as I did what was instructed. I am interested in open-source
software development, Big Data Analysis and the web.
I love to travel, listen to pop and progressive rock music, and surf the waves of the internet when I am free."
