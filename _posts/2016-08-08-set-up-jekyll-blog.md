In this article, I will be going to quickly walk you through how you can set up your own basic personal blog/website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - which you can modify afterwards according to your own needs.

### What is Jekyll?
* * *

You must be probably wondering why should you use Jekyll over Wordpress or any other CMS platforms. Well, Jekyll is a static site generator created by [Tom Preston-Werner](//tom.preston-werner.com). What it does is - instead of using any database, it takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Ngnix or any other web server. It is flexible and supports front-end frameworks such as [Bootstrap](//getbootstrap.com/), etc. According to Jekyll's [README](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown) file,

> _it does what you tell it to do, no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content._

Jekyll is the engine behind [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  That means you can serve your website directly from your Github repository **without worrying about any hosting!**

Unlike Wordpress-that is built with a server side scripting language like PHP, a static website generated by Jekyll is **fast**, **consumes less web resources**, **more secure** (due to absence of any databases) and **convenient to host** (free by Github Pages).

### Install Jekyll
* * *
Make sure you have ruby and ruby gems already installed on your local machine. Read the documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Now open up the terminal and type the following command line:

{% highlight shell %}
sudo gem install jekyll

{% endhighlight %}

Once done, run this command to ensure that jekyll command is functioning.

{% highlight shell %}
jekyll -v

{% endhighlight %}

You'll see the Jekyll version as shown:

## Create a Jekyll Site
* * *
You can either use default Jekyll theme or find one for yourself on 
the internet. For this tutorial, we are going to stick with the default theme.

Head over to Github and create a new repository by the name `{your-github-username}.github.io`. My username is _UtkarshGpta_, hence my repository will be named as `UtkarshGpta.github.io`. Now go to your repository on Github and copy your HTTPS [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) URL as shown:

![HTTPS clone address](http://i.imgur.com/cBt3JBo.png)

Now launch the terminal where you want to keep your project on the local machine and run the following commands:

{% highlight shell %}
cd your-github-username.github.io
git init
git remote set-url {your-git-https-url}
jekyll new {your-github-username}.github.io

{% endhighlight %}

Now you have your blog set up on your local machine. To view it, just run:

{% highlight shell %}
jekyll serve --watch

{% endhighlight %}

You'll see some _"Server address"_. Open that address link on the web browser, and you can now see your blog running on your local machine. Now you're all set up and can edit this default theme according to your own needs. It should look like this :

Now before adding any new posts, we need to understand the directory structure of Jekyll. I recommend you to go through the Jekyll [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) too.

### Understanding Jekyll's Document Structure
* * *
What Jekyll does is, you give text written in your favorite markup language, be it [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [Textile](https://txstyle.org/), etc. it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files and generates a static website. You have full control over what the content would be, how will it be displayed and all. The basic directory structure of jekyll is:

{% highlight plaintext %}
.
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.markdown
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2005-10-08-hello-world.md
|   └── 2016-04-02-another-post.md
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html

{% endhighlight %}

First comes the `_config.yml` which is written in [YAML](//yaml.org/). It is the _blog's configuration_ file where we can specify the blog name, permalink format, host, port number, etc.

`_layouts` is where we put customized layout for our page or posts. From here we control how and where our content is to be viewed.

`_drafts` directory stores the drafts of the posts you want to publish. They won't get published until you move them to `_posts` directory. 

`_post` is the directory where we sae all of our posts written in Markdown or Textile. These files will be compiled by the Jekyll engine and we get a generated website in `_site` directory (don't you touch it).

`_data` directory contains well formatted site-data.

Start by editing `_config.yml` file in the root directory. Change the title, description, author name and all. When you're done, you're now ready to write a new post.

### Writing a New Post
* * *
As already mentioned earlier, posts in Jekyll are written in either Markdown or textile. You can use [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) cheatsheet to write your post in Markdown.

### Naming Convention
Posts in Jekyll need to follow a particular naming convention: `year-month-date-{title-slug}.{file-extension}`

Just open `_posts` folder and edit the files keeping the format intact. Don't touch the Post Front-matter, i.e. the text between two `---` lines except for the post title and date. They tell the parsing engine to compile these files. Copy this all and make a new markdown file and name it according to the convention. Now using the cheatsheet, write your blog in plaintext in Markdown and save. Refresh and you'll see the changes.

Save your changes as for now. In the next post, I'll write how to host this blog of yours with Github Pages and access the blog online. Meanwhile, you can customize the files in `_layouts` folder to change the way content is presented and read around the bits of code.
