Hey there I'm Utkarsh. Known as **UG** by classmates, I am currently pursuing Electrical Engineering from IIT Roorkee although my heart resides with **web** and **software development**. I am a teetotaler, self-motivated developer with an interest in music - though couldn't play any xD. I keep myself updated about recent developments in technology and explore fields. Interested in **entreprenuership**, let's see how it goes!

During my leisure time, I listen to **music** and watch TV Series. I love to travel-to explore. Late night outings - mostly walking is preferred. Being a teetotaler, I can't resist myself grabbing a cup of coffee. What say ?

Look around here or my [Github](https://github.com/UtkarshGpta) profile, or shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:utkarshg1408@gmail.com?subject=Mail from Blog)!
